IEEE-CO-Mapping
===============

Mapping of CO using a WSN is our first-hand solution-proposal, in a bid to resolve the inevitability.
A WSN being largely successful in implementations worldwide (Sensor Andrew: CMU, Pennsylvania, US) the network
we shall setup will embody the best of them and available.

II.Technical Objectives
=======================
To build a fully operational sensor unit, sufficing all raw data collections, accurate and reconfigurable.
The final unit shall be a readily fabricate-able PCB.
Access to archived data on phones/tablets.
Functionality to add-on new sensors without any software or network changes.  
Facility for real-time polling: The user can demand information from any deployed module by a request message.
